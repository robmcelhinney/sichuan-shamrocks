  We aim to be a dual code club. Looks like rain, Ted. Come on, Dougal. It's your go. I must say, Father Hernandez, it's been wonderful having you over. But I expect you're homesick for Cuba.

        Gaelic football (Irish: Peil Ghaelach; short name Peil[1] or Caid), commonly referred to as football or Gaelic,[2] is an Irish team sport. It is played between two teams of 15 players on a rectangular grass pitch. The objective of the sport is to score by kicking or punching the ball into the other team's goals (3 points) or between two upright posts above the goals and over a crossbar 2.5 metres (8.2 ft) above the ground (1 point).

        Hurling (Irish: iománaíocht, iomáint) is an outdoor team game of ancient Gaelic Irish origin. One of Ireland's native Gaelic games, it shares a number of features with Gaelic football, such as the field and goals, the number of players, and much terminology. There is a similar game for women called camogie (camógaíocht).
